To Do:

Ian:
Make sure the control stuff works
Construct prototype electronics
Fix problems he creates

Peter:
Improve GUI appearance
Find specific Arduino or knock-off Arduino boards that meet our requirements:
	-Geolocation
		-SIM900A
	-3G/4G connection
		-Cheap, but uses 2G connection SIM900A ~$20, could be good for prototyping
	-GPIO pins
		-All arduinos have gpio pines in the form of analog I/O
		-Arduinos can also have their digital pins specified as in or out
	-Python execution
		-Arduino cannot run python, as it is a microcontroller, however witht he help of a
		 wemos d1 mini esp8266, you can run python code and stream live video

Caleb:
Document existing code
Make adjustments to bad logic (probably Ian's fault)
